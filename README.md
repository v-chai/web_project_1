# Practicum Web Developer Bootcamp - Project 1
## Languages
- HTML
- CSS

## Description
This is the first project I made for Practicum's Web Developer bootcamp. Practicum provided a design brief as well as the image resources. I completed all coding in HTML and CSS.

In the second part of the project, I added the animations and transitions, new content sections (including embedded Youtube videos), and restructured the CSS code according to Nested BEM organizational principles. 

## Key skills utilized in this project
- Flex columns and rows
- Animation
- Overflow
- BEM methodology for CSS 
- Nested BEM file organization  

## Possible next steps
- Checking the code for cross-compatibility and adding all the necessary vendor prefixes
- Designing a form that allows users to submit a comment
